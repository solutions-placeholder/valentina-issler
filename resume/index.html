        <h1>Career Advice</h1>

        <h2>Top 3 Tips</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Apply, apply, apply</strong> — You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take. Don’t pre-reject yourself by worrying about funding or logistics.</li>
          <li><strong>Be yourself</strong> — Authenticity will help you find the right match. You don’t want to perform every day at work.</li>
          <li><strong>Rejection is redirection</strong> — If it didn’t work out, it wasn’t aligned. Better to know now than be stuck later.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why am I giving this advice?</h2>

        <p>Many intelligent, bright people don’t land opportunities due to a poor understanding of what a personal statement really needs to do. I’ve lived in Brazil, Spain, the UK, and Belgium — and I’ve seen how different the education and hiring processes are. For instance, Brazil focuses heavily on grades; in the UK, once you hit the grade threshold, your personal statement becomes the differentiator.</p>

        <p>I’ve helped over 50 people refine their personal statements. Not all were successful — some got in, some didn’t — but I’ve learned what works and what doesn’t. Successful ones led to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Offers at top UK universities</li>
          <li>Master’s programs in the US (including UC Berkeley)</li>
          <li>Training contracts at leading law firms</li>
          <li>Graduate jobs at competitive companies</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I’ve been rejected too — like not getting into Imperial — which helped me grow and improve. My personal statements did help me achieve:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>An undergraduate degree from UCL (BASc)</li>
          <li>A job at a startup (Sweatcoin) straight out of uni</li>
          <li>A training contract (and lawyer role) at a top 5 UK law firm</li>
          <li>A network of brilliant people I’ve helped, who now help others</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What makes a good application?</h2>
        <p>This advice comes from my experience applying in the UK and US. I can’t speak for every system, but one thing is universal: <strong>your personal statement needs to be personal</strong>.</p>

        <p>Here’s the structure that works:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Why this subject or job?</strong> Tie it to your personal life — not generic passion.</li>
          <li><strong>Why this university or company?</strong> Be specific about why you’re a good cultural fit and what excites you about it.</li>
          <li><strong>Why you?</strong> Talk about adversities, your background, or identity — and how these shaped your perspective or teamwork.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>It’s not about claiming to be a team player — it’s showing <em>why</em> you are one.</p>

        <h2>Example statements</h2>
        <p>I’ve uploaded 5 real, anonymised personal statements (law, business, tech, and arts). Please <strong>don’t plagiarise</strong> — universities and companies use plagiarism detection tools. Use them for inspiration and to see how specific, human, and honest they are.</p>

        <h2>Questions to ask yourself before writing</h2>
        <p><em>(Optional: embed Typeform here and connect it to a mailing list)</em></p>

        <h3>1. Why this job or subject?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>What moment or experience made you connect with this subject?</li>
          <li>How did your family or environment shape your curiosity?</li>
          <li>What personal story makes this meaningful to you?</li>
          <li>How does this reflect who you are or want to be?</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Why this university or company?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Why does it feel like a good fit for your values and goals?</li>
          <li>What resources, professors, or programs excite you?</li>
          <li>How will you contribute to the culture there?</li>
          <li>What’s your personal connection to this place?</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Why you?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>What challenges or differences have you faced?</li>
          <li>How did those experiences shape how you solve problems or work with others?</li>
          <li>Can you give an example of a time those helped you lead or collaborate?</li>
          <li>What unique strengths do you bring because of your journey?</li>
        </ul>
